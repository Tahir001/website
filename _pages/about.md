My name is Tahir Muhammad and I love to learn, build, teach, and work on challenging & meaningful problems. Here's a snapshot of some of my key achievements: 

- 🎓 Completed 4 majors (Math, CS, Econ, Stats) at University of Toronto (UofT) in 6 years (While working some of the years!)
- 🧑‍🏫 Taught 6 courses in Data Science and Computer Science at UofT, Including Machine Learning -- A masters level course with NO masters degree!
- 📄 Published a paper in theoretical statistics on Type II censored data helping other researchers work with cancer patients data
- 🚀 Co-founded Nox, a web app helping professors gauge every student's level of understanding in real-time
- 👮 Worked with Ontario Provincal Police (OOP) and one of Canada's largest bank (Scotiabank) as an AI Research Engineer, identifying money launderers and human traffickers
- 🌍 Built predictive models for ESG companies at RBC.
- 🤖 Developed machine learning models for text recognition and summarization.
- 💼 Founded the Enterprise Risk chapter at RBC as an intern, empowering colleagues with code.
- 🏦 Strategy Data Scientist at TD Bank, leading data ingestion into Microsoft Azure Cloud.
- 🔧 Currently helping BlueCat build a data platform handling 10M+ rows/minute for threat detection.


Here's a little bit about more in a Nutshell:

- 👨‍💻 ML Software Engineer at BlueCat
- 🧪 Data Scientist & ML Engineer @ TD Bank & RBC (Previous Role)
- 🎓 Teacher & Researcher at UofT MCSS (Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences) Department (Previous Roles)

I completed my HBSc in Statistics and Computer Science from UofT, where I also taught a plethora of computer science and statistics courses as a TA. During my undergraduate studies, I also published some papers, and worked as a research engineer in two really interesting fields: Machine Learning and Theoretical Statistics. One of them led to a paper being published, whereas the other led to a pitch to ML Director of Scotiabank (One of Canada's largest bank) along with RCMP on how to stop money laundering and human traficking with the use of AI. 

In my free time, you'll find me working on my passion projects involving AI, playing video games, power-lifting, or participating in any kind of sport I can get my hands on. 📚🎮💪🏀

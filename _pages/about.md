# 👋 Hello!

My name is Tahir Muhammad, and I am a technology enthusiast. I love to learn, work on solving challenging & meaningful problems with the help of technology, and enjoy automating mundane, redundant tasks for my colleagues and friends to help spread the joy of tech. 😊💻

Currently, I am involved in a few exciting initiatives:

- 🧪 Data Scientist/Software Engineer at BlueCat
- 🎓 AI & ML Researcher at UofT
- 👨‍💻 Software Engineer at QuranJourney

I completed my HBSc in Statistics and Computer Science from UofT, where I also taught a plethora of computer science and statistics courses as a TA. During my undergraduate studies, I also published some papers. In my free time, you'll find me working on my passion projects, playing video games, power-lifting, or participating in any kind of sport I can get my hands on. 📚🎮💪🏀

Please feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tahir-muhammad-7b534016b/) for any inquiries. I'm always happy to help in any way I can. 🤝

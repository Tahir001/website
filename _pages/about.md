My name is Tahir Muhammad, and I am a technology enthusiast. I love to learn, work on solving challenging & meaningful problems with the help of technology, enjoy automating mundane & redundant tasks for my colleagues & friends to help spread the joy of tech. 😊💻

Here's a little bit about more in a Nutshell:

- 👨‍💻 Software Engineer at BlueCat
- 🧪 Data Scientist & ML Engineer @ TD Bank & RBC (Previous Roles) 
- 🎓 Teacher & Researcher at UofT MCSS (Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences) Department (Previous Roles)

I completed my HBSc in Statistics and Computer Science from UofT, where I also taught a plethora of computer science and statistics courses as a TA. During my undergraduate studies, I also published some papers, and worked as a research engineer in two really interesting fields: Machine Learning and Theoretical Statistics. One of them led to a paper being published, whereas the other led to a pitch to ML Director of Scotiabank (One of Canada's largest bank) along with RCMP on how to stop money laundering and human traficking with the use of AI. 

In my free time, you'll find me working on my passion projects involving AI, playing video games, power-lifting, or participating in any kind of sport I can get my hands on. 📚🎮💪🏀

My name is Tahir Muhammad and I love to learn, build, teach, and work on challenging & meaningful problems. Here's a snapshot of some of my key achievements: 

- 🎓 Completed 4 majors (Math, CS, Econ, Stats) at University of Toronto (UofT) in 6 years (While working full time for one of the years!)
- 🧑‍🏫 Taught 6 courses in Data Science and Computer Science at UofT, Including Machine Learning -- A masters level course with NO masters degree!
- 📄 Published a paper in theoretical statistics on Type II censored data helping other researchers work with cancer patients data
- 🚀 Co-founded Nox, a web app helping professors gauge every student's level of understanding in real-time
- 👮 Worked with Ontario Provincal Police (OOP) and one of Canada's largest bank (Scotiabank) as an AI Research Engineer, identifying money launderers and human trafficking entities 
- 🌍 Built recommendation engines and predictive models for Environmental & Social Governance (ESG) at Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)
- 💼 Founded the Enterprise Risk chapter at RBC where I organized, led, taught, and empowered my finance and risk co-workers to build with code (as an Intern!)
- 🤖 Developed machine learning models for text classification and text summarization on plethora of documents at TD Bank
- 🏦 Full Stack Strategy Data Scientist at TD Bank -> Strategizing with directors and VPs on data quality, metrics, dashboarding, and leading initiatives such as data ingestion into MS Azure
- 🔧 Currently helping BlueCat build a data platform handling 10M+ rows/minute for threat detection models, and building features for our core product :


Here's a little bit about more in a Nutshell:

- 👨‍💻 ML Software Engineer at BlueCat
- 🧪 Data Scientist & ML Engineer @ TD Bank & RBC (Previous Role)
- 🎓 Teacher & Researcher at UofT MCSS (Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences) Department (Previous Roles)

I completed my HBSc in Statistics and Computer Science from UofT, where I also taught a plethora of computer science and statistics courses as a TA. During my undergraduate studies, I also published some papers, and worked as a research engineer in two really interesting fields: Machine Learning and Theoretical Statistics. One of them led to a paper being published, whereas the other led to a pitch to ML Director of Scotiabank (One of Canada's largest bank) along with RCMP on how to stop money laundering and human traficking with the use of AI. 

In my free time, you'll find me working on my passion projects involving AI, playing video games, power-lifting, or participating in any kind of sport I can get my hands on. 📚🎮💪🏀

Over the years of working in technology, I've realized that all of us are life-long learners. Since undergrad, I've been picking up new tech stacks, languages and frameworks to develop and contribute to any project I jump on. Sometimes it can be a little challenging, but thankfully my willingness to learn adn overcome in a short period of time always pushes and amazes me. I've dedicated this page to share some notes I took when ramping up on a new tech, to share insights on how we are all life-long learners.

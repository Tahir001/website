Over the years of working in technology, I have come to recognize the significance of continuous learning. Since undergrad, I've been picking up new programming, frameworks and new tech-stacks to enhance my ability to contribute effectively to any project. Although the process can present certain challenges, my unwavering commitment to learning and overcoming obstacles has always motivated me and impressed others. In an effort to promote the idea that we are all perpetual learners, I have dedicated this page to sharing the notes I have accumulated during my journey of familiarizing myself with various technologies. I hope that these notes not only prove valuable to your own learning but also serve as a constant reminder that we are all on a continuous learning journey. No individual possesses comprehensive knowledge of everything, and everyone can benefit from seeking assistance when needed. Embracing the idea of lifelong learning and recognizing the importance of collaboration and support are crucial aspects of personal and professional growth.

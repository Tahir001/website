# My Teaching Philosophy in a Nutshell

I strongly believe in the ability of the the human brain to learn and grasp anything with consistent effort. In order to bring the best out of my students in the fields of statistics, computer science, mathematics and data science, I try to convey my enthusiasm in my lessons and show how these domains are impacting the world around us everyday. By teaching content that is engaging and focusing on the how and why we do things in this manner rather than just memorizing how to solve an equation or code a problem empowers the students to be critical thinkers. Striking a balance between the big picture, the underlying mathematical concepts and the practical implementation is crucial for a learners journey in these domains, and I try to do just that for my students.
